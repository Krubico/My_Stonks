# Yet-Another-RCNN-CV-Model

This repo contains code of a RCNN Computer Vision model built with pytorch trained on personal dataset and evaulated on the cocodataset (https://cocodataset.org/#home)

This model has:
- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
- Multiple choices of resnet backdone
- Pre-processing image layer by pytorch image transformations
- Post-processing for drawing bounding boxes
- Pretrained FasterRCNN resnet model weights from pytorch model library (https://download.pytorch.org/models/fasterrcnn_resnet...)
